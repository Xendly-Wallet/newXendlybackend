| **2FA (TOTP)**      | ✅ Full TOTP support, backup codes, enable/disable, enforced on sensitive actions      | **Good**; ensure backup codes are securely generated/stored                                                    |
| **Session Mgmt**    | ✅ Token/session table, logout all, session invalidation                               | **Good**; consider session expiry/refresh token blacklist                                                      |

| **Database**        | ✅ SQLite, schema covers users, wallets, txs, notifications, preferences               | **Good for MVP**; consider Postgres for scale, backup/restore, migrations                                      |

## 4. **User/Brand/PM Perspective: Is This a Good Wallet?**

- **User:** All core flows are present, multi-asset ready, secure, and easy to use. 2FA, notifications, and clear error messages are a plus.
- **Brand:** Clean, professional, extensible, and ready for future assets and compliance.
- **PM:** All MVP features are present, but **rate limiting, logging, monitoring, and backup** are required for a safe, scalable launch.

## 5. **Summary Table: Launch Readiness**

| Area                | Ready for Launch? | Notes/Actions Needed Before Launch                |
|---------------------|:-----------------:|--------------------------------------------------|
| Core Wallet Flows   |        ✅         | All implemented, multi-asset, tested              |
| Security            |        ⚠️         | Add rate limiting, structured logging, monitoring |
| API Documentation   |        ✅         | All endpoints/types in Swagger UI                 |
| Notifications       |        ✅         | Email/in-app done; add SMS/push if needed         |
| Database            |        ✅         | SQLite OK for MVP; add backup/migration scripts   |
| Compliance          |        ⚠️         | Add KYC/AML if required                          |
| Operations          |        ⚠️         | Add backup, monitoring, alerting                  |

## **Next Steps**

1. **Implement rate limiting, structured logging, and monitoring.**
2. **Add DB backup/restore and migration scripts.**
3. **Review CORS and secrets for production.**
4. **Add integration tests and audit logging.**
5. **(Optional) Add KYC/AML, SMS/push, user feedback, and API versioning.**

---

**You are extremely close to a production launch.**  
With these final improvements, Xendly will be a robust, secure, and user-friendly wallet ready for real users and real money.

Would you like to proceed with implementing these remaining production features? If so, which one should we tackle first?
